# XRD Queue Application for HRL Laboratories
#### by Ryan Chang

This app was created for the usage of an X-ray diffractometer. A sample, a silicon wafer for example, is submitted to the queue by a scientist requesting a scan. The submitted sample is placed in the queue in the order which it was received. Users can view the global queue to find their position in line as well as their own queue to see how many samples they are waiting upon. The diffractometer operator is given admin privileges to toggle the samples as scanned as they are actually scanned in the machine. Several features were created around the diffractometer operator to maintain scalability of the app for operator posterity.

A demo with dummy data is available [here](https://polar-forest-18181.herokuapp.com/).
